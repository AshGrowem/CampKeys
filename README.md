Mac keyboard shortcuts for [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/boot-camp).

## About

This project aims to combine all of the myriad AHK scripts out there for Bootcamp mac shortcuts into one definitive open source, non-coder-friendly app.

Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

### Inspiration

<!-- I love my Mac and the Apple operating system. It's the sandbox in which I discovered and nurtured my passion for programming. Mac's beautiful and intuitive design helped inspire me to eventually create my own software, which is partly what inspired CampKeys. -->

In my discovery of using Boot Camp to play games on my Macbook I was sad to see that only a handful of Mac keys (volume up/down, etc.) were remapped, and there was zero support for mac-style keyboard shortcuts. Having to re-learn all of the handy keyboard shortcuts I had used as a developer on mac was a headache. Not to mention that all of the windows Boot Camp shortcuts wouldn't easily carry over to a regular windows keyboard since they are layed out differently. I decided could NOT give up my mac keyboard shortcuts. Enter CampKeys...

In my search for Mac keyboard shortcuts in Windows I soon discovered Autohotkey and immediately began to stitch together existing snippets and gists to create my own Mac keyboard shortcuts emulator. It turns out that many others have had this same need and resulting solution, although there seemed to be no up-to-date or actively maintained official Autohotkey script. This project aims to be the **_de-facto_** open-source Autohotkey script for Mac Keyboard shortcuts emulation on Windows. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
