# CampKeys

âŒ˜ Mac-style keyboard shortcuts for [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/boot-camp).

## About

> :warning: This is a WIP, GUI is in development! :bowtie:

An open source, non-coder-friendly app for Mac-style Boot Camp shortcuts. Made with :purple_heart: using [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)!

Contributions and feedback are more than welcome!

### Inspiration

In my discovery of using Boot Camp to play games on my Macbook I was sad to see that not all of the Mac-specific keys were remapped (Mission Control, Launchpad), and there was zero support for Mac-style keyboard shortcuts. Having to re-learn all of the handy shortcuts I had used daily as a Mac developer was a headache. Not to mention that all of the Boot Camp Windows-style shortcuts wouldn't easily carry over to a regular Windows keyboard since they are layed out differently. I decided could NOT give up my Mac keyboard shortcuts!

## Install

### Exe

## Supported Keyboard Shortcuts

:information_source: Based on [official Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) for Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

### (Not included in [docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236))

These are shortcuts that aren't included in the official docs, but are still built-in to all Macs

- **F3**: Mission Control _(windows Task View)_
- **F4**: Launchpad _(windows Start Menu)_
- **Command-Q**: Quit
- **Command-Delete**: Delete Line

### Cut, copy, paste, and other common shortcuts

**\* = Supported by Key Remapping**

Ex. Command-C for "copy" is supported because the Left-Command key is remapped to Right-Control, and Control-C is already a Windows shortcut

(All other shortcuts are supported by an AHK [Hotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm) script)

- \***Command-X**: Cut the selected item and copy it to the Clipboard.
- \***Command-C**: Copy the selected item to the Clipboard. This also works for files in the Finder.
- \***Command-V**: Paste the contents of the Clipboard into the current document or app. This also works for files in the Finder.

- \***Command-W**: Close the front window. To close all windows of the app, press Option-Command-W.
- **Control-Command-Space bar**: Show the Character Viewer _(windows [Character Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_Map_(Windows)))\_, from which you can choose emoji and other symbols.
- **Control-Command-F:** Use the app in full screen, if supported by the app.
- **Command-Tab**: Switch to the next most recently used app among your open apps.
